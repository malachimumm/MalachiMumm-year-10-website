    <h1>Freestyle</h1>
   <p class="description">Freestyle is a race or event where swimmers are allowed to use any stroke they choose. While any stroke is allowed, the vast majority of people use the front crawl due to its speed and efficiency. The technique of this stroke is lying prone and flat just below the surface of the water and the legs perform a constant flutter kick, the stroke begins with one arm extending forward in line with the shoulder and entering the water, it then scoops downward and backward towards the thigh.</p>
