    <h1>Butterfly</h1>
   <p class="description">Butterfly is a stroke where the swimmer propells themselves foreward face down, with both legs moving simultaniously and an up-down "dolphin" kick with the legs. It requires consistent timing, strength and fitness as it is one of the hardest and most physically demanding strokes.</p>
