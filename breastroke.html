    <h1>Breaststroke</h1>
   <p class="description">Breaststroke is a stroke executed by swimmers laying down face first in the water, propelling themselves foreward in a frog-like kick while the arms simultaniously push foreward from the breast, then sweep backwards in a cicular motion. It enchances coordination, effieciency and muscle development, mostly in the chest, shoulders and legs.</p>
